1 pound (450g) dry pasta

Freshly ground black pepper
Parmesan cheese, for serving

  <span className="Instructions">Instructions</span>
  <div  disabled className="BuffaloChicken1" rows="4" cols="20">

1.
Place pasta in a large skillet or saut√© pan and cover with water and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Boil until just shy of al dente, about 1 minute less than the package instructions recommend.

2.
Meanwhile, heat garlic and 4 tablespoons (60ml) olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat, stirring frequently, until garlic is softened but not browned, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook, stirring, until tomatoes begin to burst. You can help them along by pressing on them with the back of a wooden spoon as they soften.

3.
Continue to cook until sauce is rich and creamy, about 5 minutes longer. Stir in basil and season to taste with salt and pepper.

4.
When pasta is cooked, drain, reserving 1 cup of pasta water. Add pasta to sauce and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring and tossing constantly and adding reserved pasta water as necessary to adjust consistency to a nice, creamy flow. Remove from heat, stir in remaining 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil, and grate in a generous shower of Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately, passing extra Parmesan at the table.

Add butter and shallots and continue cooking, stirring frequently, until butter is lightly browned and smells nutty, about 1 minute longer. Add sage and stir to combine (sage should crackle and let off a great aroma). Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice. Set aside.

2.
In a medium saucepan, combine pasta with enough room temperature or hot water to cover by about 2 inches. Season with salt. Set over high heat and bring to a boil while stirring frequently. Cook, stirring frequently, until pasta is just shy of al dente, about 2 minutes less than the package directions. Drain pasta, reserving a couple cups of the starchy cooking liquid.

3.
Add pasta to skillet with squash along with a splash of pasta water. Bring to a simmer over high heat and cook until the pasta is perfectly al dente, stirring and tossing constantly and adding a splash of water as needed to keep the sauce loose and shiny. Off heat, stir in Parmigiano-Reggiano. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper and texture with more pasta water as needed. Serve immediately, topped with more cheese at the table.

1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 to 2 teaspoons red chili flakes (see note)
2 tablespoons (30ml) brandy (optional)
1 (28-ounce; 795g) can whole peeled tomatoes and their juices, coarsely pureed or crushed by hand

1.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. In a medium bowl, toss the shrimp well with the 1/2 teaspoon salt and the baking soda. Set aside.

2.
In a large skillet or saut√© pan, heat 4 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering, Add reserved shrimp shells and cook, stirring constantly, until they've all turned a reddish color, about 4 minutes. Off the heat, remove the shells using tongs, a slotted spatula, and/or a slotted spoon, allowing any excess oil to drain back into skillet as you go; discard the shells. You should still have plenty of oil left in the skillet.

3.
Return the skillet to medium-high heat, add the shrimp, and cook, stirring and turning occasionally, until shrimp are just starting to brown in spots and are almost fully cooked through, about 3 minutes. Off the heat, transfer shrimp to a plate and set aside.

4.
Return the skillet to medium-low heat. Add garlic, oregano, and chili flakes and cook, stirring, until garlic is just beginning to turn golden, about 3 minutes. Add brandy, if using, and cook until almost fully evaporated. Add tomatoes and clam juice and bring to a simmer. Season with salt.

5.
Boil the pasta in the pot of salted water until al dente. Drain, reserving about 1 cup of the pasta cooking water, and add pasta to the sauce along with a splash of the pasta cooking water. Add shrimp and cook over medium-high heat, stirring, until the sauce reduces and clings to pasta and the shrimp are fully heated through; add more pasta water as necessary if the sauce becomes too dry. Season with salt, if necessary.

6.
Stir in parsley and remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Serve right away.

Meanwhile, in a large skillet, combine oil, garlic, and pepper flakes. Cook over medium heat until garlic is very lightly golden, about 5 minutes. (Adjust heat as necessary to keep it gently sizzling.)

3.
Add tomatoes, stir to combine, and bring to a bare simmer. When pasta is ready, transfer it to sauce using a strainer or slotted spoon. (Alternatively, drain pasta through a colander, reserving 1 cup of cooking water. Add drained pasta to sauce.)

4.
Add about 1/4 cup pasta water to sauce and increase heat to bring pasta and sauce to a vigorous simmer. Cook, stirring and shaking the pan and adding more pasta water as necessary to keep sauce loose, until pasta is perfectly al dente, 1 to 2 minutes longer. (The pasta will cook more slowly in the sauce than it did in the water.)

5.
Continue cooking pasta until sauce thickens and begins to coat noodles, then remove from heat and toss in cheese and parsley, stirring vigorously to incorporate. Stir in a drizzle of fresh olive oil, if desired. Season with salt and serve right away, passing more cheese at the table

Test Kitchen Tips
‚Ä¢  Take a page from the "magnificent everything bagel" by adding 1 teaspoon each of dried garlic, onion and sesame seeds to the butter mixture.
‚Ä¢  Get little hands involved by having them place cheese in the bread.
‚Ä¢  Make it your own by switching up the cheese (we love smoked Gouda and gooey Brie), customizing seasonings, and adding meaty mix-ins. Bacon, diced salami or ham with sliced olives are all great choices.

Directions
1.  In heavy bottomed pot over medium-high heat, brown pork cubes on all sides then transfer to plate. Remove excess oil/fat from pot and return to heat. Add in ginger and onion, then saut√© for a few seconds or until fragrant. Put back pork cubes and add in 2 Tbsps fish sauce and stir for a few seconds. Pour in stock and lemongrass and allow it to come to a full boil.
2.  Cover and reduce heat to simmer. Add chili, lime leaves, and tomatoes. Simmer until pork is tender (about 30-40 minutes).
3.  Add in diluted tamarind paste, calamansi juice, brown sugar, fish sauce, and coconut milk. Test soup for spice and salt, adding more chili and/or fish sauce (instead of salt) as desired. If too sour, add 1 tsp brown sugar. If too salty, add a squeeze of calamansi juice. Add more coconut milk if you want your soup richer/creamier, or if it‚Äôs too spicy for your taste.
4.  Add in rest of vegetables except kangkong or spinach. Simmer for another 8-10 minutes or until vegetables are crisp tender.
5.  Turn off heat, add in kangkong or spinach, cover, then wait for a minute or so before serving. Garnish with both red and green chilies. Serve with steamed white rice.

1. Place pork cheeks and belly in a small pot with the 1 cup vinegar, bay leaves, salt and pepper. Add enough water to just cover and boil for 20 minutes. Drain liquid and set pork aside to cool. You could do this step the night before too, if you want.

2. Heat up a grill pan on the stove and grill the pork pieces on all sides until charred and crispy (approx. 20 minutes). Can do this step on an outdoor BBQ if you have one.

3. Remove pork from grill and dice finely. Mixed diced pork in a bowl with soy sauce, 3 tbsp vinegar and butter. 

4. Heat up a pan and add the oil. Saute the ginger and garlic until fragrant. Stir in the diced pork mixture. Allow pork to crisp up before stirring/turning to cook the other side till crisp too. Stir in the mayonnaise.

5. Heat up a hot plate, if using. Once hot, add the pork onto the plate. Sprinkle with onion, pork crackling and chillies. Make some room in the middle of the plate and add the egg. Serve with calamansi (or substitute). Complete this step directly in the pan if you're not using the hot plate. Eat immediately with steamed rice.

 INGREDIENTS
2 pounds oxtail, cut into serving size
water
1 banana heart
2 large eggplant, ends trimmed and cut into 1-inch thick
1 bundle long beans (sitaw), cut into 3-inch lengths
1 bundle pechay, ends trimmed and leaves separated
¬º cup rice flour
1-1/2 tablespoons annatto powder
1-1/2 cups chunky peanut butter
1 tablespoon oil
1 medium onion, peeled and sliced thinly
4 to 5 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
2 tablespoons fish sauce
salt and pepper to taste
shrimp paste

Instructions
Rinse oxtail under cold, running water and with a knife, trim excess fat. In a deep pot, place oxtails and enough water to cover. Over medium heat, bring to a boil, skimming any scum that accumulates to top. Lower heat, cover and simmer, adding more water as needed to maintain 6 cups, for about 2 to 3 hours or until oxtails are easily pierced with a fork. Drain oxtail, reserving about 6 cups broth.
Peel and discard the outer, fibrous skin layers of banana heart until you reach the lighter, softer core. Trim off stem and discard. Cut banana core into half and into fourths. In a bowl of cold salted water, place cut banana and soak for about 15 to 20 minutes. Using hands, squeeze to release bitter sap. Rinse with cold water and drain well, discarding liquid.
In a pot over medium heat, bring about 4 cups water to a boil. Add banana heart and blanch for about 1 minute. With a slotted spoon, remove from liquid and set aside. Add eggplant and blanch for about 1 minute. With a slotted spoon, remove from liquid and set aside. Add long beans and blanch for about 1 minute. With a slotted spoon, remove from liquid and set aside. Add pechay and blanch for about 30 seconds. With a slotted spoon, remove from liquid and set aside.
In a skillet over medium heat, add rice flour and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and toasted. In a bowl, combine toasted rice flour and ¬º cup reserved broth and whisk until smooth.
In a small bowl, combine annatto powder and ¬º cup reserved broth. Stir until powder is dissolved and color has dispersed.
In a bowl, combine peanut butter and ¬Ω cup of reserved broth and stir until well-blended.
In a large pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add onions and garlic and cook until limp and aromatic. Add oxtail and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned. Add fish sauce and cook for about 2 to 3 minutes.
Add the remaining 5 cups of reserved broth and bring to a simmer. Add annatto water, rice flour mixture and peanut butter mixture, stirring well to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Continue to simmer for about 10 minutes or until it begins to slightly thicken. Add blanched vegetables and cook for about 2 to 3 minutes or until heated through and tender yet crisp. Serve hot with shrimp paste on the side.

 INGREDIENTS
Makes 30

prep tim- 1 hour, cook time- 20 minutes

1 pound ground pork

30 large shrimp

4 cloves garlic, minced 

1/2 cup chopped onion

1/2 cup grated carrots

1/2 cup chopped water chestnuts 

1/2 cup chopped green onions

1/2 cup thinly sliced green cabbage 

1 teaspoon ground black pepper

1 teaspoon salt 

1 teaspoon garlic powder

1 teaspoon camaron molido (ground shrimp, optional)

1 teaspoon soy sauce

1 egg

1 egg white, for sealing rolls

30 lumpia wrappers/spring roll wrappers (MENLO brand are my favorite but any will do as long as they are of the paper-thin variety. NOT egg roll wrappers as they are too thick and have a bubbly texture that doesn't quite work with this recipe)

2-4 cups vegetable oil, for frying  

VINEGAR DIPPING SAUCE:
1/2 cup white vinegar

3 garlic cloves, crushed

Salt and black pepper to taste

1. Prepare  your vegetables by chopping your onion and green onion, and mincing your garlic and water chestnuts. Thinly slice cabbage. Grate carrots 

2. In a large bowl, combine ground pork, onion, garlic, carrot, green onion, cabbage, pepper, salt, garlic powder, soy sauce, egg and ground shrimp. Ground shrimp is sometimes hard to find, I usually get mine at a Filipino grocery store,  or in the Mexican spice section of the supermarket. Rest assured, the Lumpia will still be delicious without it. 

3. Peel and devein the shrimp, leaving the tail intact. To straighten the shrimp for the lumpia and to make sure they don't curl up as much while cooking I made little "release cuts" inside each shrimp. It's super simple- I make 2 slits, starting with the middle and then another about an inch over (away from the tail)

4. Separate the wrappers and keep the ones not in use from drying out by laying a damp cloth over them. Place about 2 heaping tablespoons of the meat mixture onto each wrapper and getting wrapping! Seal the edge with egg white. 

5. Heat a heavy skillet over medium heat, add oil and heat for about 5 minutes. Make sure oil is hot enough before adding lumpia by testing the edge of one. If it bubbles and sizzles, it's ready! Fry them until they are a nice golden brown color, about 3-5 minutes on each side. Drain on paper towels.

6. Serve with vinegar dipping sauce for an authentic Filipino flavor, or a sweet chili sauce which can be found at most Asian supermarkets.

Separate the wrappers and keep the ones not in use from drying out by laying a damp cloth over them. Place 1 heaping tablespoons of the meat mixture onto each wrapper, one shrimp on top, and ger wrapping! As you roll, be sure to keep it as tight and compact as possible without breaking the wrapper. This will keep the fillings from falling out during the frying process.  Seal the edge with beaten egg white. 

5
Heat a heavy skillet over medium heat, add enough oil so that it's 2 inches deep and heat for about 5 minutes. Make sure oil is hot enough before adding lumpia by testing the edge of one.

1 cup organic raw almonds soaked for 8-12 hours
4 cups of purified water
Instructions
1.Place the raw almonds in a glass bowl or large jar, and cover with filtered water for 8 hours or more. Cover with lid.2.Rinse the nuts several times to remove any of the anti-nutrients and enzyme inhibitors. If soaking for more than 8 hours, make sure you rinse and soak a few times.3.Pour boiling water over the almonds and let them sit for five minutes. Drain. Skins should peel off easily.4.Put almonds and water in a powerful blender and start blending at low speed. Blend them with less water for 1 - 2 minutes in the beginning, so they become a really smooth paste.5.Add the remaining water. Blend everything together for another 2-3 minutes, until it is completely smooth and frothy.6.Use a fine mesh strainer or place 3 or 4 layers of fine mesh cloth over a metal strainer set over a bowl,jar or jug. Pour small amounts of the almond milk through the strainer into the bowl. Use a spoon or spatula to press down on the strainer and move the solids around.7.Once most of the milk has passed through the strainer, gather up the mesh cloth and gently squeeze it to remove excess liquid.8.You'll be left with really fine almond meal inside the mesh cloth. You can discard it, or you can dry it out in a very low oven and use it in place of almond flour in baking recipes!
